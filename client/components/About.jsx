        <h2>About me!</h2>
        <p>
          I am a full stack web developer with over 700 hours of coding
          experience in a simulated work environment at Enspiral Dev Academy
          (EDA). I chose a career in Web Development because I love solving
          problems. Above all else I can bring enthusiasm and a willingness and
          capacity to learn. I am a strong believer in having a growth mindset
          and looking at problems and roadblocks as exciting new challenges. I
          love that I can continue learning and growing every step of the way.
